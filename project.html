                        GiT family is a multicultural family like Eindhoven. We bring along our own cultural
                        background
                        and share and
                        adapt to the new one. One of such being the Wedding Culture; a culture celebrated in
                        different
                        forms in
                        every
                        part of the world and for most of the spouses, the connecting factor between them and the
                        Netherlands.
                        After a couple of exchanges on wedding culture during our GiT meetups, it was interesting to
                        find not only
                        the
                        unique forms of different wedding celebrations, but also the similarities. Yes! The names of
                        the
                        rituals are
                        probably different but the idea behind certain rituals share common ground.
                        So, with that beautiful experience came the idea of organizing a GiT Wedding
                        Photo-exhibition.
                        We slowly
                        began
                        our journey into this project. But unsure where and how, we were trying to figure out a way
                        to
                        make it
                        possible.
                        And meeting Petra Cardinaal from the Pennings Foundation came as the answer. We then had the
                        what, which
                        expanded overtime, how and where.
